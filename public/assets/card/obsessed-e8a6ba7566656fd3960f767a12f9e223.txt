I sit outside his house, watching him through the kitchen window. He is so beautiful, so alluring. There is no road back from loving him now. He is just loading the dishwasher, but with a slat of sunshine across his face, and a curl draped across his forehead he could be an angel deposited here. But he isnâ€™t an angel, he is real flesh and blood. He was mine, and he will be again. He smirks at some unknown thought, and I pray it was me. Please be thinking of me, like I am wishing for you.
