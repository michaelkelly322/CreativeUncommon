6:17 P.M. thirty hours without sleep. Hard to know real from Not Real. Un Real. Sur Real. Too Real for me to process. I gave up four hours ago. Been laying on the bed, I think. Waiting for madness to overtake me, or sleep to overtake me, whatever is threatening to overtake me. I wait. I exist. It is enough, but not satisfying.
