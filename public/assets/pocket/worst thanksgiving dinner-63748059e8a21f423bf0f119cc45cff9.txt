The first thanksgiving dinner I ever cooked was the most dreadful gastronomical experiment. While it cooked, I checked on it as often as I would do later for my daughter the night I brought her home. I didn't bother to season the turkey, but I did remember to shove it full to overflowing with dressing. Finally after the little plastic plug popped a half day later, we sat down to eat. It wasn't until my dad was chewing the turkey, meanwhile scanning the table for a moisture savior, I remembered you are supposed to cook gravy with the gizzards I didn't remove. He just smiled, told me what a good job I had done, and took another agonizing bite.
