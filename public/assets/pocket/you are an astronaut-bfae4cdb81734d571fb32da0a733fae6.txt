There is a moment between the time I wake up and when I open my eyes that I forget. Normally, this would be unpleasant, but today I am overjoyed. In this moment I remember I am in outer space. Surrounded by the impenetrable silence of the greatest unknown. After brushing my teeth and washing my face the anticipation has nearly gripped me. I make my way to my post and am finally greeted with the greater view in the world. A round three foot porthole with the Earth centered in the frame. I am right where I want to be.
