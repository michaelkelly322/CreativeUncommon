The cadence of the various bugs at this hour of the morning usually sends the chariots of dreams to ferry me away. This night, however, seems determined to be lived through, afraid to have my moments stolen by sleep. Outside the owls and crickets are wide awake, with their misery demanding to be shared. As I lay awake thinking about creation, I wish for some cosmic panacea. It is more likely to I will just achieve a listless day tomorrow. I toss a rhythm into my mattress, two turns left, three right, but still I canâ€™t find the spot where my muscles relax into comfort.
