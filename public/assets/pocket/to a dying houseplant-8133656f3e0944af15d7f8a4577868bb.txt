Life is hard. Without pain there will be no joy, so you are going to feel some of both. The only way to participate in any of it is to live. So you wake up every morning with the sun on your leaves and air in your cells. You have to scream it with every fiber of your being that you intend to live, because that is your right as a living being on this planet.
