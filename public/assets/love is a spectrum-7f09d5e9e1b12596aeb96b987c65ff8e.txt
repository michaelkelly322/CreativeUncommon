Global asking what’s (ab)normal
Shadowed moments hum electric
watching softer light core porno
Sexy beauties, most are women 
Newton’s theory with dramatics
Inside province of erotics
Every concept has an equal
Every zealot ‘gainst a rival

I think it is unfair
having to hide my love
I think it is unfair
taking rights to frank life
My groom’s groom called corrupt
I do not understand
Answer my love with hate?
We fail eve to begin
I do not understand
changed not in any way 
they loathe us unsupported

I hate them
thinking they should die
Wildly better planet if they did
talking about homo sexuals makes me sad
accepting watching females, girls on girls
seeing fucking, see them play
Dildoes and vibes too
I love them

We are the only beast with freedom to act
and it is sadly man alone that wants that
Boy and boy canine are not mating like this 
zoos teach bonobos to live homosexually

Like in a joking way, you know, humor, a kid
I wore my girlfriend's clothes just larking one time
just to be jesting, I like having fun times
I hate the boring girls with vacant eyed voids

Who wanna see my penis cry?
show titties to me horny girls
You’re saying like it’s crying tears?
no coming in reality
I’m celibate so cybersex
Is option one and only
they open up their body and
I’m horny and without real wife
I’ll only fuck in marriage bed
a self hedonism pact

any decent woman wanting virtue
trusting honest, righteous Muslim order 
always outfits modest, humble clothing
fully robed, wholly hairstyle veiled 
women open dresses, showing bodies 
mortals wanting beauty, wanting sexy
Holy acting without ever tempting
Wholesome fellas marry saintly women
marching purely into delayed evening
Parent’s shaming lessens ever slowly
nearly matching water rinsing Crisco 

isolated separate
neighbor World War alarmists
braiding oh so nimbly with
Social green technology
frightening grenade bomb thoughts
Normalcy perplexes me
Honestly my sexual 
Attitude resists the norm
Urges mine alone to keep
Wanting hints what normal is
Even use of taboo ‘sex’ 
Acting doesn’t change, knowledge does

From right about five years old 
When I eloped by the swings
’Til third recess, that wee fool,
then up to today I haven’t
been by myself for two weeks 

divorced in the late nineties
tried dating for a minute
Discovered I am insecure
And pretty much a shipwreck
not sexy, big, or skillful
I focused most on oral

to translate my love
in Brazilian 
Like, in Portuguese
we say ‘buceta’
A purse holding on
to most precious gems
a sweet pussy’s taste
is too marvelous
and this melting act
are all women owed
Some get orgasms just
From the kissing of 
Arm, leg, belly, neck
Them I really like

I’m excited by
The forbidden things
Play with boundaries
Knee high stocking legs
That’s my favorite
The first instant my
dick slides into her 
I like jealousy
I like hearing her
paint me stories with
Her past lovers and
They excite me and
I despise them all
simultaneously
Domination fix
makes me horny just
let yourself go just
in the moment just
I love choking her 
and hard spanking too

I had d/s
its gross, dom/sub?
yeah didn’t like it
It’s not o-kay

Truth of normality 
rooted in reality
I wanted a soulmate 
Do nothing but caper
Create as a twosome
Without add on judgment
Feels selfish though somehow 
All people are rightly
entitled to pleasure
Before now my answer
Would likely have differed 
but mores and normal 
they alter, and people 
belong to themselves now

I'm pretty (ab)normal
