Serenity of accomplishment
Tasting like the sweet dark red
Of a strawberry.
Feeling the weight of the music
On my chest,
And the smell of his smile
In my nose

I can remember his chest
The delicious comfort,
And effortless release
Explosions soft as rain.
The gentle whisper
Of the sunlight
The ancient magic
Of a kiss.
