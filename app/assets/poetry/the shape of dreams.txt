What is the shape of the American dream?
Is it round like the donuts we eat,
Or the world that we live?
Is it square with hard sharp edges,
And comfortably straight lines,
Where everything fits perfect
In itâ€™s nice neat little box?
It is more like a triangle,
With perfectly formulaic angles.
Or more like the squiggles
Of a hopeful little child?
Is it really the container
In which the symbols sit?
Or the store we buy it in?
Is it really like the vortex,
That sucks us toward our death,
Or could it be amorphous,
Flowing like electrons
Pulsing near the center?
