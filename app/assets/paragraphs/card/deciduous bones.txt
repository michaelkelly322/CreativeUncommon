Maybe all of our evil resides in the bones. Like coat tails hanging from your back, they can fall away like the leaves of a tree when we are ready. When you choose something really evil, your skeleton bones come out and dance. They twirl around, deciduous bones on display. They jangle like the ominous sticks hanging from winter dead trunks in a cemetery, they hoot and holler like demons set free.
