&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The doorjamb sticks. I throw my weight against the door to get inside. I hear a constant din of noise. There are rustling papers, half a dozen hushed conversations, feet, machines, its like an active bee hive. The atmosphere is heavy, and sour with the sting of cleanser. The light is dim on this side of the room. The source of excitement is not immediately clear.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I see the furniture has been oriented so that the room appears only six by six. Upon further observation I see a bright white glow emanating from the bottom edge of the wall on the left. Without that it would just seem as though an impromptu meeting has sprung up between local police, military officials, and doctors. Waiting just inside, to the right of the door, is a man with a rifle slung across his shoulders. He is                   clearly wasting no time with pleasantries.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Why are you here?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am Gabriel, from the Chronicle. I was sent here to write up a story on an individual of interest.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“The police said no media. They are having a press conference tomorrow.” I look around, unsure if we are talking about the same thing.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Look man, I am going to be honest with you. We are about a hundred miles from where Jesus lost his sandals. Just let me do this interview so I can get on my way.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am going to assume you don’t know what’s going on here.” His hands move vaguely about trying to grasp the correct words. “There are some unpleasant, and time sensitive aspects to all of this.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	His eyes narrow as he tries to tell me something I don’t understand. I look around, equal parts wanting, and not wanting to know what is on the other side of the glowing wall. He starts getting flustered, trying to decide whether he is allowed to let me in. His face lights up with what he decides is a magic question.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Who called to ask for the interview?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I usually know better than to give out that information, but I am not getting in otherwise. If I don’t get in, there is no story. I give the name, and the man’s face drops. He steps aside, and I am unsettled by his lack of response. With him out of the way, I can see the opposite wall is plastered in framed photographs buried behind medical equipment. The frames are neglected, but the pictures inside are in perfect condition with no folds, scratches, or creases. I scan the faces, but there is nothing remarkable.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Below sits a low, long bookcase that had once been covered in papers and albums. Now they are all pushed aside to make room for IV syringes, handcuffs, tubing, vials, and the type of restraints used in hospitals. I am writing it all down so I don’t have to remember these particular details later. The bookcase is only knee height so I crouch down on my heels to look at the titles more closely. The left half is fiction, Poe, Anais Nin, William Burroughs, Catcher in the Rye, and I am starting to get a feeling for who this man is. The other side is laden with boxes of all types and sizes. There is metal, plastic, and wood, all fitted with the same delicate little lock.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	As I stand back up I see an open file tucked under a package of syringes. It looks like a psychiatric exam, but I am no good at deciphering the doctor’s scribble. I can make out something about fire and souvenirs for ritual something. My hands are shaking, but I don’t feel like any of this is worth writing down until I open one of the boxes.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	A little flutter of ashes flies out, and I understand what I am seeing here. I jerk my hand back from the box, dropping the lid as if it tried to bite me. I work at the newspaper, so of course I have read about the missing men and women, all found burned beyond recognition. They failed to find a connection, and so far most of the recent rash of arsons are unsolved.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I realize the shaking is showing in my writing now, but I can’t stop it. I can only step away from the bookcase, and move to another part of the room. I have no desire to go towards the glowing wall anymore, so instead I turn to the opposite side. I have to ask a hefty guard to move to the side, and what I see knocks the breath clean out of me. I look at all the people standing around having no reaction, and I wonder is anyone here sane.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	It is installed floor to ceiling with a heavy, but delicately carved bookcase. Filling every single section in its massive mahogany frame is a menagerie of hundreds of dolls, each dressed in its Sunday best. Every single doll has been stripped down to a hollow emptiness. Someone has removed every pair of eyes, causing no harm to the doll but a zombie-like void. A twelve-foot wall of soulless faces staring past me into nothingness.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I was wrong. No need to investigate more. I need to do the interview so I can leave. I will write this story, and then forget about it all. I turn towards the glowing wall. Now that my eyes have adjusted I see someone has created a bottleneck with a few panes of wood.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I turn away pretending to use a table to write in my notebook, so that I will keep my feet. I definitely can’t look at the dolls anymore. In fact, just feeling them back there is giving me goose bumps on my arms and neck. The trouble is, just past this false wall is the man who has lovingly collected and removed the eyes from those dolls.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is another guard at the bottleneck, but he doesn’t ask any questions. He is probably here for keeping in, rather than keeping out. Once I am through the space, the brightness makes me feel a little sick. It is as if I am standing too close to a coal engine. Along the edge of the wall and ceiling the doctors have installing flood lights all pointed towards the middle. The buzz of voices sounds louder than a football game in here. There is monotonous beep and hum of machinery creating a perimeter. It is sterile, but still full of movement. Some of the machines snake from the middle out to others beside the walls, and all the bustling bodies avoid these areas. Dozens of people stand here and there in clusters monitoring the outputs. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I notice a nurse eyeing my pen with a mixture of concern and desire. She doesn’t have one, and I assume there is a reason, so I put it and the notepad in my pocket. I won’t forget any of this even if I want to. I stand in the room feeling trapped worse than the middle of the mall on Christmas Eve. Barely anyone stays still for more than three-seconds at a time. Everyone is involved in some ongoing conversation. It is so persistent I can’t hear any particular words. I just watch and listen as though it is an opera.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	In the center of it all he sits in a chair. I can only see the back of his head, and I can’t find a path around the crush of people. Everyone ignores me as I move slowly trying to find his face. That is when I notice no one is looking at him directly. They are keeping their eyes averted towards the machines instead.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I circle around, at first with a great distance in between. He slumps into the welded metal chair, and I want to see his hands before I get any closer. I see handcuffs looping through the steel bracer, and his feet too, which explains his crouched position. I take another step, and try to avoid a line winding from his wrist.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I can see from here his hair is perfectly groomed. It was impossible to tell from the back, but in profile everything from the crest to the sideburns is gelled, and styled to perfection. It briefly reminds me of my great aunt’s funeral. Her hair had been surreally perfect, and it bothered me. His cheekbones are too sharp, and eyes sunken back too far. He can fix his hair, but he can’t change the bruise colored bags under his eyes. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	His chin has a little dimple that is disarming, and something deep inside is counting the steps between him and me. As each foot lands one in front of the other in a slight arc, time fades to a theory. I allow myself to stop directly in front of him before my worst fears are confirmed. Even though his eyes are physically intact, it makes no difference. Those blue grey orbs have long since left this plane, and are staring off into nothingness just like his dolls. His face shows no recognition of the movement all around, even when the nurse comes to prick him with a new needle. He must still be alive, or else the monitors would make more noise, but it is hard to tell for sure.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Then his eyes begin slipping very slowly until they lock with mine. His lips move, and I see he is trying to say something. I move in just a little closer, and I hear him say more clearly, “I called for the interview. I want you to see this.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I am staring into the windows of his soul, all the way down into the basement where all of humanity’s worst fears live. I can feel it. This man somehow knows every dirty little secret I ever had. He smiles, and it appears that he approves of my hell. Or maybe there is more to it than that. I am allowing the reverse, and suddenly I feel violated by this man’s soul.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Even restrained, inside of his head he is dismembering every single person here. Inside, he is setting fire to this whole room, and cackling at the flames. He is locking the door, and burning us all to ashes. It would be his one final shrine to all our most evil of deeds.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I didn’t notice everything was reaching a fever pitch. The machinery explodes in noise, and movement in the room halts. Everyone plays musical chairs with a piece of machinery, or needle in his arm, huddling in and pressing me back towards the wall. I just follow the tide helplessly, allowing the others to break the spell.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The nurses swarm, obeying commands yelled by the doctors. They keep shooting me dirty looks for staying in the way. The machinery screams for half a minute, and then the silence. Suddenly, none of the doctors are talking. None of the nurses are running. Even the guards seem to have abandoned their posts to start gathering their things.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The doctors back away and all that leaves is the limp body of an accused serial killer. His eyes are still the same cloudy sky color. He has finally joined the ranks of his lifeless dolls and ash. At some point I slid to the floor against the wall, I don’t know when. No one offers me a hand, and I couldn’t accept if anyone did.
