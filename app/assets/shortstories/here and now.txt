Reynold

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I am walking down the street, and everything is Botticelli buried inside a Crumb comic. I know that the Venus is in here somewhere hiding, just waiting to be born. As for today, I crane, twist, and look it is all skeletal junkies, and absurdly proportioned women's asses. I feel deeply that everyone else sees it too, just no one is talking about it. Instead, I hear things like this. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"I got a new phone the other day. I think it is excellent! How much did yours cost?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"It was five hundred dollars, then two hundred dollars a month for the five year contract."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"That right there! That is exactly why I preordered mine."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Oh, no way! I wish I had done that now..." 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Blah, blah, and blah. l move out of earshot, and sigh in relief. Little by little, the muscles in my hands release, but my elbows and shoulders stay tight. Any second now, I will encounter another pair, and I will surely be treated to another round of stimulating conversation. I am no better, but at least I know how to fix myself.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I am standing in the middle of the living room with chaos erupting around me, and all I can think of is a personality test I took a long time ago. It said the clothes are on the line, it is starting to rain, the phone is ringing, and there is someone at the door. Real life test time Judy. What do you handle first? According to the test, if I go to the door first, then my friends and relatives are the most important. Truthfully, I have no idea who is at the door; but I am still not going to answer it. It is the same for the phone. That one is supposed to represent your career, but I have no job, and I am still not picking it up. If I went for the clothes, it means sex, but I don't either way. The entirety of my attention is on the television. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is a robbery in progress, at a bank three miles away from here. I know exactly where it is. If I were to let my feet flee, as they definitely desire, I know precisely how many steps it would take to get there. My fear and anger are the size of kickballs in my chest, because I know what the robber is at the bank to retrieve. Worst of all, now I realize exactly who is at the door.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	If I had gotten any sort of warning, I could have made it out the window, no problem. Down the fire escape, a brisk and refreshing run later, quick business at the bank, and out of town in a blink. But if there is already someone outside of my door, the time for that strategic maneuver is over.	

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	All right Judy; this is real life test part two. Now you have to avoid the phone, the door, and who gives a shit about the clothes on the line. Actually that last one isn't a terrible idea, maybe I could sex my way out of this situation. Ironically, in this moment, that choice seems a little too disingenuous. For whatever reason I think, I can do this with my wit alone. I have absolutely no evidence to support this, but I think it anyway. I can do this, and I can find a way to keep that jerk at the bank from getting what he wants, too. Everything is going to be just fine, and I am filled with a completely irrational sense of calm.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	It's everything I can do not to pee on myself. I am just standing here, and I don’t know what to do. My mojo is telling people no, that is what everybody says. It's not much, and it's not as if that’s how I introduce myself at parties.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Hey, I am the guy who tells people ‘no’ all day. I am just so good at denying people what they want. Down at the bank, well don't tell anyone, but they call me the King of Rejection." 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	But this situation, it’s not my thing. The section in the bank manual on an attempted robbery says that you give them anything that they want. But what he is asking for I can't give him. I don't have the power, or more realistically, the key. That doesn’t stop everyone from looking to me. They want me to fix this, because I am the one who fixes anything, usually by telling someone ‘no’. This is truly an impossible situation, so I give in to the only urge I can. I pee. It takes a few minutes for everyone to notice, but then at least nobody is watching me to see what to do anymore.


Judy	

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I know just where the creaky floorboard is in the living room so I soundlessly hop over it. It takes extra care to make sure the desk doesn't protest its age, and I thumb quickly through the various options I find. Helena sounds good, so I pull out the corresponding information, and grab my jacket from the closet. It takes the simple fluff of my hair and I am who I need to be. I wait out a few more knocks, and purposefully hit the creak on the way back across the floor. I toss open the door, and lean my body against the frame. The man standing in front of me wears a suit and tie, but I can see the bulge of a gun inside his jacket, and against his leg. Oh no, it's a cop. I would have never gone with Helena, but it’s the identification currently on my person, so I have to deal with it now. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Sorry officer, I was taking a nap. Can I help you?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"I am looking for Judith Merries. Is that you?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"No sir she is my cousin. I am staying with her for a few days."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Is she here?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“No, sir."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I answered too quickly. His head cocks to the side, and he eyes me up and down. I respond by shifting my weight from one side to the other.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Could I see some identification ma'am?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	One. Two. "Why?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"I will ask you again ma'am, are you Judith Merries?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Three. Four. "No."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Let me see your license, please."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Five. Six. I reach into my side pocket, and pull out the correct wallet. He is watching me closely, so I make sure to flip it open right in front of him. It is expertly worn around the edges and right in the very middle is an Alabama Drivers license: Helena Victor. Shitty name, I use it mostly for mob interactions, but the cops know it now. I silently pray that particular name doesn't have any outstanding warrants in this county. The cop’s eyes flip rhythmically, like the cat's tail in those asinine clocks they sell at the Cracker Barrel. I.D.-me-I.D.-me-tick-tock. It all matches, but I can see in his eyes somehow the math doesn't feel right for him.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"I showed you mine, now how about yours. What division should I tell her is calling when she gets back?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	He pulls out his badge with space in the back for his cards, and looks at me again before thumbing one out. I deftly snatch it at the peak of extension, and flick my eyes expecting some variation of the alphabet soup. Instead, I double-take because the man is a homicide detective with the Local 82. My mouth falls open in genuine surprise, and my first thought is, I am too late, and Reynold is already dead. I turn back to the TV, but there is still a live feed of his idiot-self holding up the bank. So I look back to the cop. He is taking in my reaction, and I swear I can see written all over his face that he does not believe my bullshit license. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I need to be extremely delicate, and all I want to do is shake him to get the information I need. I sag against the door again, and reach my arm around to the wall. He can't see but I am flexing and gripping my fingers to try to release the excess energy I suddenly feel surging through my body.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Is there something I can tell her you need?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Look. I don't have time for games with little girls. So when your cousin," his voice is strained, and he rolls his eyes, "gets home tell her to call me, and we can discuss it then."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	He drills me one more time with his eyes, and then turns to walk away. I take a deep breath, but my troubles are just getting started. I get one more breath before I am back at the drawer stocking up on aliases, and I take my own advice from earlier. I only permit my favorite apartment one longing look before I crawl out the window for the last time. I come out here for cigarettes all the time, so it is an easy motion to locate the pack and the matches off the overhang. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I light one for the road, and I am quick footing towards the bank. I need a plan, which means a stop at the coffee shop. Thankfully, Margine is working today, so I don't even have to go inside. I lean on the front glass, and appreciate a moment to think with my smoke. Inhale-exhale-inhale-exhale, easy and rhythmic. It is cold enough that my breath is making its own smoke in the air, but at least it means my ankle length thick jacket with about a million pockets is completely acceptable. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Margine brings out my thinking fuel, and I offer her a cigarette in trade. We shoot the shit for a minute but then her boss pokes his head through the door yelling something at her in Chinese. She grunts, and stamps out her cigarette with a faded nondescript tennis shoe, and stumbles her way back inside. All right girl, now it’s time to think.


Bernard

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Wetting myself worked great. So well in fact, I am able to slip away into my office to change, and call the police. I dial 911 and the operator is brisk.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“State your issue.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"My bank is being held hostage."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Is this the Freedom Alliance Bank?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Yes."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Yes, sir, we are aware. Our hostage negotiation team is setting up now, and will hopefully establish communication soon. Has the robber asked for anything?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Yes, he wants to get into the safety deposit boxes, but we need both the keys. They just won't open without both the keys!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Do you know who has the key he wants?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"No!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Okay, then sir there isn't much I can do on the phone with you right now. We are receiving an abnormally large number of calls. Answer me one more question please, sir. Has anyone been injured?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"No."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Well, then we are going to conclude the communication so that we can keep lines open both at the bank, and on our end."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"We have about fifteen phone lines..." But it is no use. She has already hung up. It is as though she can smell the pee on me. I am destined to be a ridiculous pariah for the rest of my life.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I sit and continue my pity party for another few minutes before I make my way back out into the lobby. Nothing much has changed, and the robber is dancing around the blinds near the front windows mumbling about what the cops are doing outside. Meanwhile I am contemplating my next excursion. This would be the perfect time to break into the single barrel scotch hidden in my bottom desk drawer. Then the situation changes drastically.	

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Everything goes so quickly the real life images blur as I try to figure out where my eyes should land. The phone rings a hollow echo through the marble of the bank. It startles the robber, who jerks around to find the source. I don't see exactly, but I guess the security guard decides to seize the opportunity. He pulls out a gun from his holster, and aims it squarely at the robber. He has a mask over his face, but he must see well enough because he swings his extremely large rifle towards the guard. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	A beat, then he thinks again, and instead points it towards one of the tellers sitting against the wall. I am sitting diagonally from her, not even on the same wall, but suddenly the involvement of innocent bystanders occurs to me. I am thinking, damn if he points the gun at me, I am going to pee myself again. I don't even have any more pants. Blur again, and the gun is waved towards some banging in the back of the room. A slight of a girl in a pale green dress steps out with a gentle tip-tap from the vault. She is yards into the room before she looks up at the unusual silence.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Crap."


Judy	

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is a parade going on two streets over from the bank. One would think they would call it off in lieu of the robbery. I guess the word didn't make it, because I am stuck on this side of the road, and the bank is just a little further that way. I now have an imposed sentence of planning. The plan up to now was just wing it, but I sit on a bench smoking cigarette number two, and this mom keeps shooting me dirty looks.	

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Reynold, my ex-boyfriend, and ex-crime collaborate, the freak that he is, over there robbing a bank. I don't know how he imagined he would get out alive much less with the information that he needs. He has to know he is drawing the cops big time. I briefly consider that this could be a trap, but if it is, wow. It is far too elaborate for the Rey I know to have accomplished. He wasn't exactly the brains of our operation. He was more the brawn and rage type, so none of this answers the basic fives of this situation. What is he thinking? Why is he doing this? How is he planning to get out? 	

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	This only leaves me with two choices. I can sneak in the back door, and steal what he is there to get. I could be gone and safe, but with no answers. Or I can walk in the front door, and probably die with good ol' Rey. But at least then I would know. And for the first time in my life, I actually want to know. So I wait out the parade, feeling just like I did as a kid. Completely apathetic, and waiting for it to be over. Then, like a chicken, I cross the road to get to the bank heist. I guess that means front door and winging it.


Bernard	

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Her name is Vivian, and after the Security Guard talks the robber into pointing the gun back towards him, she comes and sits down next to me. Since the robber never answers the phone they revert to communication with him through a loudspeaker. They keep repeating his name as often as they can. They are trying to humanize him I guess. They are really just driving me crazy, and Vivian isn't helping.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"This is really bananas Bernard. It is like Sophie's World, I am stuck inside a snow globe, except the snow globe is my anti-luck. I can't seem to crawl out of it. I got another rejection yesterday, the fifteenth in two weeks. Just can't seem to crawl out of it."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Reynold, we know you are in there. Reynold, if you could just call us on the phone then we could help you-Reynold, to get what you want."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"I mean how can a person be just so unlucky? My cat got ran over the other week, I told you about that. Well, yesterday this guy was going to ask me out, but my uncle came by and said that we were standing on his property and we had to get off! It just totally ruined the mood, so he just left without making the date."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Reynold, we know you can hear us. We know that you want into the safety deposit boxes, Reynold."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The two voids in the ski mask shoot towards me. Apparently, my escape didn't go completely unnoticed.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Reynold, we can't get you the key you need until you talk to us, Reynold!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"I have written seven books, and not one has been published, Bernard! I have been painting for ten years, and not a one of them has sold. And then, I come to get the last of my savings bonds to be cashed, and I walk out into a damn robbery!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Twenty-six voices, with the emphasis of a gun, ring out at once.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Shut up, Vivian!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Vivian, will you stop!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Please lord, shut up!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Stop it please!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Bang, bang, bang!

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Vivian!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Oh my!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Truly."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Bang, bang!

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"I mean, really?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Everybody just shut up!"
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	All eyes are back on Reynold. Even outside the cops stop talking, but the phone starts ringing again. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"There has to be a way to get into those boxes without the damn key!"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Vivian clears her throat, and I can hear the trouble coming. I pinch her in the side, she yelps, but she stops talking too, so I smile. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"What has you smiling Bernard?"	

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Crap, crap, crap. I skitter my eyes for escape, but it is too late. My worst fear has arrived, and he is pointing the gun at me. I don't pee right away, so that gives me momentary hope, but every time I look away he steps closer. I can’t see his eyes, because they are in shadow from the mask. So I have no where to look but right at the gun. This is terrifying, and I don't know what to do. So I just start babbling.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"No, nothing. I just wanted Vivian to shut up, so when she started talking I pinched her. That's all I figured she was going to tell us some story about one day when she wanted to get into her box..."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Two pokes with the gun. "Shut" jab. "Up" jab.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Thank god my mouth stops moving. It is a wonder since my brain is no longer in control. It has closed up shop, and gone out on vacation; reading a book on some beach, laughing at the squishy vulnerabilities of the flesh.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"You stopped her from saying something. Does this girl know something I need to know?"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Still no words. I look around for some assistance, but no one is helping. I hold off on doing the one thing I really don't want to, but everyone is avoiding me so I give up. I look to Vivian, and her foolish savior mouth obeys at once.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Of course there is another way in. You go in through the vault and follow it all the way around and it comes in through the back. You only need one key to get into it that way. I was having sex with Bernard back there just before all this started."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I am terrified, and I am mortified. All around are faces mixed in shock, humor, and pity. Reynold bursts out laughing, and at least the gun isn't on me anymore.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	"Now we are getting somewhere, people!"


Reynold

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	It's all been nonsense until now. Empty words soaking up every other thought with self-absorption, until finally, someone gives me a bit of useful information. Color me truly surprised it is that girl. Thankfully, the security guard is distracted by her outburst, and I recover first. I point the gun at the idiot, and his little idiot friend, and take my first steps towards getting the hell out of here. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Show me where this sex vault is, Casanova.”	

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	He gets up, and for some reason the girl gets up too, savings bonds still in hand. The phone is still incessantly ringing, so I walk over and slam the butt of my gun down on it, stopping that noise for good. I take the keys that I got off the guard when I first got here, and make sure the doors are locked. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Any one tries to leave, and I will kill you all.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I turn around and follow the idiot and his girl through the doorway, around a corner into an outer chamber, then finally into the vault where I receive the second major shock of my day.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What are you doing here, Reynold?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There standing in front of me is Judy, and I note she is sitting between my goal and me.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I really could ask you the same thing, Judy.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am pretty sure you don’t have time for all of this. Any moment the police could bust in. I will look like an innocent bystander, and get away with everything.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	I grunt before I answer, I knew she would never understand.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“This needs to be done. You need to let this happen. It is the only way for us to get on with our lives.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“No, I don’t think it does.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I know, that is why I really hoped you wouldn’t come.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	 I raise up my gun, and shoot her, one bullet in the shoulder. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	She cries meekly from the ground, the first time I have ever heard that.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Rey?” 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	She will be just fine, this will be over in plenty of time for her to get the attention she needs. I am right, this needs to be done, and now she can’t stop me. She already has the box out of its space, and it is sitting next to her on the floor. I walk over, pick it up, and turn around back out towards the lobby. Once there, I unlock the front door, and put my gun down. I  grasp the box with my left arm, I put my right arm in the air and use my hips to open the swinging door. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	As I surrender to the police, they take all my possessions and handcuff me. My mind is at peace. I think distantly about everything that will happen now, but at least it will be what is right. Inside that little box is tools, papers, and then the most important part of all. It is a USB drive with a list of all the things that we have learned in our illicit activities. Things that will not only get us in trouble, but many very important people as well. It is all for the best though, now I can start to rebuild.
