&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is a grey door sunken into the wall, and it is the only place for your eyes to land. You sit in a chair, no table, and stare with eyes glazed. You think about how doors usually hold an impetus. They are usually filled with the potential of those who might walk through them, but this door feels impotent. You idly wonder if it is still a door, even when not in use. Does the definition of the door require employment, or does it simply imply the possibility?

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The walls match, equally dull in their incapacity. You sit motionless with your own thoughts. Before this, you never had the time to think. Now, for a change, you have nothing but time. You unfortunately also find yourself with nothing on your mind. You get excited when you begin a very interesting train of thought about how your mind is just a muscle that is tired, and probably just in need of a workout. You decide to start at the beginning. You decide to think about thinking. Descartes had it perfectly illustrated long ago. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You think therefore you are. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Only what you think, exists.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	To what extent can you think something into being? Surely, it would take total knowledge of something to create it from pure imagination. What do you believe so thoroughly that you could detail into reality? 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The door’s uselessness is temporarily suspended. It seems to be glowing with its knowledge of what it is. You feel bitter.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Enter Dr. Kimberly Whitmore.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The doctor pauses after walking in the door, and swivels on her modest heel after only two steps inside. From directly outside the door she retrieves a chair, and carries it back in as she enters for a second time. Kimberly places the chair at a right angle to you. She looks distraught for a moment as she scans the room for a table of any kind. 	When she realizes there is no such refuge she concedes to placing her files and clipboard in her lap, and looks at you for the first time. She gazes deeply at you as if trying to recall some memory far off in the back of her mind. Then she turns away to flip open the top file in her lap. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What is your name?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I’m not really sure right now.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Does that mean that you know what it would be at another time?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What does it say it that file?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“It says Jane Doe.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is a silence as you hide your reaction, and Dr. Whitmore does her best to see through the facade.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You squirm and respond, “I like Jane. I think you should call me that until I remember.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“The problem is that we have no history for you as Jane Doe. We don’t know if you have any preexisting conditions that could help us understand what you are going through now.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Is that what you like about this? Do you like that as Jane Doe we don’t know anything about where you came from?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I really don’t remember very much.” You look away. 	

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Why don’t you tell me what you do remember?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I remember a room before this one. It was not grey, but it was the same somehow. There was not much in the room but some chairs, and a table. The whole room was orange, and it felt like the inside of James’ giant peach. I never really liked the color orange, and this room didn’t do much to change my mind.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What happened in the orange room?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t remember what happened. I just had this feeling. It was bad.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	She pauses for a moment to consider. “Jane, I have an associate I would like you to meet. This man is a specialist, and he will help us assess your current mental state. Is that okay with you?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Yes, I think so.” You smile, and after a few seconds, it shifts into a smirk. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“May I ask if that smile is about something you remember?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“It is just another feeling.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What kind?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I have been here before.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Kimberly leaves for about fifteen minutes and returns with a traditionally handsome young man. He has an overly strong, square jawline, and you have to squelch the bile that rises into your throat. You plant a smile on your face, and move your eyes away to his perfectly styled blond hair. Rather than a lab coat he opts instead for a well tailored suit and tie. He takes the seat previously occupied by Dr. Whitmore, while she hovers near the doorway. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Okay Jane. This is Dr. Moyhannon. He is a psycho-neurologist, and he is going to work on some personality tests with you. Okay?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	He watches you. It makes you uncomfortable so you are the first to speak.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Moyhannon.” You roll his name around in your mouth. “Moy-hannon is a very interesting name. What is its origin?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“This really isn’t about me. Let’s keep the focus on you.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Your reaction compresses, like the time your mother reprimanded you by popping your hand with a spoon. You pull your hands in protectively, and flash your eyes to Kimberly’s face. The doctor is no help. She is distracted by some unseen figure right outside the door. She barely leans back in to shoot a perfunctory check in your direction, 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Okay, well I am just going to leave you two alone for a while. Maybe try to get this room upgraded a little bit. I will see you guys again in about twenty minutes?” She waits for your head to move before she turns and leaves. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Exit the good doctor.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“So I see here I should continue to call you Jane.” 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Yes.” I add hopefully. “Please.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“And that is because you refuse to tell us who you are. Even though it could help us out infinitely.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I just don’t remember.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t believe you.” He says this as casually as you would take off your shoes when you get home in the evening.


&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Excuse me?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is a new kind of pause, much different from Kimberly’s. This doctor has a relentless stare, and does not use his files to distract. When you finally look away, it is to your hands in what Moyhannon perceives as a shameful move.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t remember.” You repeat, “I don’t remember.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am here to test a few things, so we can get a better idea of what is going on.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“How are you going to do that?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Well, since you lack experiential memory, we are going to try some cognitive situational reaction tests.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What does that mean?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am the one who is supposed to be asking the questions here Jane. It explains itself really.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You cannot even make it up to his hands. You just keep gazing downward. Dr. Moyhannon is making you feel like scum he wants to wipe off his shoes. You wait until he is satisfied he won’t get an answer, and looks away to the booklet. He pulls a pencil out of a hidden inside pocket of his jacket, and marks down some information.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You slowly seize your opportunity. You slide your eyes first to the wall beside his head, and then working your way to his face. You are studying anything you can see from the periphery, praying he doesn’t see through your antics, but you know he has when the tension in the rooms goes gravitational.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Dr. Moyhannon looks you straight in the eye, and it flashes a shiver all the way down to your toes. His eyes are a bright reddish brown color, almost like a cat’s eye. If they are supposed to be the window to the house that lies beyond, you should run because it is on fire. The sparks behind his eyes are malignant, and threaten to spread to your mind like the devilish cancer it represents. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	It lasts for a second, then Dr. Moyhannon goes back to his booklet as though nothing happened. While you are irreparably changed. If feels as though something inside you has pulled open at the sight of what is in his eyes. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Alright Jane, let’s get this started. The first question: how would you describe your state of mind right now?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Frazzled.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Could you be more specific?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“No?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Okay, then.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	He scribbles a few notes keeping the booklet angled away, which only serves to make you more on edge. You sit up straighter trying to see, but he stops. Then he starts back and makes things worse by adding a clucking sound. He finally turns back to you, and prepares to plow ahead with the next question.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Number two: you are walking in a forest, how far apart are all...”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Wait! You aren’t going to tell me what my answers mean?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Why in the world would I do that?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You are asking all these weird questions, and I want to know what they mean!”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You don’t want to give us any information about you. Why should we help you in a way that you won’t help us?” He says this factually, as though any person of the slimmest intelligence would find it obvious. You default to the only answer you have been able to give, and it is starting to feel like a mantra.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t remember! Maybe if you told me the answers, then I would be able to remember.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I highly doubt that Jane.” The way he says your name, it is dripping in acid. The full force of his eyes returns to you. You try the best you can to hold his eyes, but they burn you once again.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Question two: you are...”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Your voice comes out barely above a whisper, “You really aren’t going to tell me?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am really not going to tell you.” A quick pause and then, “You are walking in a forest, how far apart are the trees?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am not going to answer any more questions.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“That really isn’t up to you. You are going to answer these questions.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“No, I want Kimberly back. You are being very mean to me.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Her name is Dr. Whitmore, and neither she nor I am here to be your friend, Jane. You will answer these questions or you will never leave this room.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What? You can’t do that. That isn’t up to you.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I can and will do that if you don’t answer the question.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t think it is wise to threaten me Dr. Moyhannon.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Fine.” He makes a few notations, and then looks back at you. “I don’t have time for this.” Dr. Moyhannon closes the booklet and puts the pencil back in his jacket. He stands up and two steps towards the door. His body is a flash of lightening, and all you can think to do is yell at him, “No!”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	He turns slowly, and his eyes do not find yours right away. They start at your toes and crawl their way up, as though he is weighing your heart from the sum of your parts. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“No? No what, Jane? No, you don’t want me to leave you here alone, forever?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t know.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“That’s all you can say? You still want to act this way with me?” He is full of rage at this point, puffed up to twice his size with his great breath gusting in and out. It creates a palpable breeze around the room that feels too warm. Its like the days in summer when you just have to go swimming or you might melt to the ground.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Suddenly this sparks a memory, your father one day is desperately angry with your mother. She has locked herself into the back room of their house, and father has come out to find you. He finds you floating in the pool on your back with your head halfway below the water, so it takes you a moment to recognize his voice yelling your name. When you finally recognize it, you jerk up and swim for the ladder. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	As soon as you see him, you know he is in a terrible mood so you start to move a little slower, and stay further back than you normally would. He is yelling, but you can’t quite make out the words; all you can see are the eyes. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	In that moment, you feel there is nothing else available to do. You are looking at the precise replica of the furious eyes from your memory in the face of Dr. Moyhannon. His nostrils are flaring and his top lip pulled into such a tight sneer you can see the roots of his incisors. Then, out of your mouth flows the words you have remembered.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Only what you think, exists.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“My name is Juliet. My name is Juliet.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Dr. Moyhannon remains angry, but the spark is gone from his eyes, and the forceful wind is gone from his breath. His top lip relaxes, and he looks like he is angry for different reasons. It is in this moment, the door cracks open and Kimberly walks back inside. Dr. Moyhannon, still standing, turns on his heel again and says as he walks out, “We are done here.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Kimberly raises her eyebrows, “What happened?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You can’t help the smile from blooming across your face. “My name is Juliet.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	After this revelation, you look strung out so Kimberly ends the session for the day. She sends you back to the padded room that is standard for a patient of your status. The next day back in the empty grey room, you find some new surprises. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“As you can see I had limited success with upgrading our room yesterday. This wing is fairly new for these purposes so we are doing what we can on a budget.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is now a table in the room, which you assume Kimberly demanded. There is also the unexpected alteration of two bulbs replaced in the ceiling. The effect is that one corner of the room is now white. You were completely unaware before, until the contrast of it draws your attention. The whole room is probably white, but you just can’t see it yet. It is just an effect of the abandonment of light. You chat about the table and the lights for a few minutes before you offhandedly mentioned the day before. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Well, I think your discovery is fantastic, Juliet. It is definitely a start. Maybe soon we can add a last name to that. Then we can know a lot more about where we need to go from here.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am just glad to know more than Jane Doe. I think it is enough for now.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Okay then, the next thing we want to do is talk about what brought you here. Do you remember anything about that?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I remember the orange room. I remember flashes of running. I think I was in a swamp that had many caves. Then I was somewhere with a lot of water, and these islets that ran all through it. The water was crashing all around, and it must have been fed from some ocean because the waves were breaking all over the place.” 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You pause, a little out of breath and look at your hands. This is a habit you can’t seem to break. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“That is good. That is a lot more than we had before. You are covering some things that didn’t come in with the report so this is all very good. What else?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You can’t continue. If you do, you will have to tell what comes next. You don’t want to do that, at least not yet.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What are you waiting for, Juliet?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Your voice’s tremble gives away your lie, “I don’t remember.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Then I will start from what we do know after that. You were running up and down the pier in the main thoroughfare of San Francisco, yelling some frightening things. I quote, ‘they are coming, and they are going to get us all.’”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Kimberly pauses in hope that you will interject. You just kept your eyes on the knothole in the table. After the perfunctory moment the doctor sighs, and continues.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You had a short stay in a San Francisco prison, but after a 440 exam you were admitted into the local hospital psychiatric ward.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	She moves slowly from here, carefully gauging your response to the words. “Your stay in the psychiatric ward was a little longer, almost two weeks, but they were ill equipped for your, um, particular situation. Then a different ward for a week as a transition, and then one more for about a week and a half, before you arrived here.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I think that was a strictly clinical view of a truly awful time.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I can imagine that to be true. Your paperwork probably doesn’t even tell the full story of your experiences over the past two months. Does any of this information help you remember what happened in between? Maybe what happened in the orange room? Do you know your last name?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“No.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Do you want me to go into more detail about the time in the psychiatric facilities?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“No. Those parts I remember.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I see. What is left that we can talk about?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t know! I am not the one in charge here. I am as far from in control as I could possibly be. Short of an inmate in prison!”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t know if that is true. Soon you will be able to mingle with the other patients here in the facility. You have choices on foods, and you technically could choose your clothing but you didn’t bring any with you.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“That is certainly a laugh riot, doc.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“It sounds to me like you are having a sad day. Things aren’t really as bad as you are seeing them.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“How would you even know? You see me for two sessions and you have it all figured out? What no other psychiatrist could figure out in two months, you have down in just a few hours?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“No, we are both aware that psychology does not work that way.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I have no idea how psychology is supposed to work, and I really don’t think you do either.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Under ideal circumstances, for example if we knew your medical history there is a possibility we could progress in a more timely manner. I have dealt with cases much more serious than yours, and I have always found that healing happens as it is ready.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is a pause as you work your mouth, noticeably chewing on the words that in equal measure you do, and do not want to say.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You want to know what happened in the orange room.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Juliet, what I feel has no bearing on this situation. It is about you.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	This defuses the anger behind your eyes, but does nothing to soothe the sadness that started soon after you started to remember. It is a distant melancholy like something for which you forgot to apologize. And it was a bad, bad thing to have done.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	For now, you don’t want to think about it anymore. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	This is why your anger returns when in that moment Dr. Whitmore asks, “Do you feel comfortable with telling me what you are thinking about?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am just feeling a little sad today.”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Is it just a general feeling, or for a particular reason?”

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“It really isn’t important, I just feel sad.” After a few seconds, you mumble to yourself, “It isn’t even safe to have an emotion around here.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Now I really don’t feel like that is fair, but I suppose it is an understandable reaction to have. How about we turn the tables a little bit and you ask me some questions for a while.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	A little light sparkles in your eyes at the opportunity, one that the doctor has not seen before. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“About what?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Anything that you would like: this facility, me, or maybe your own file. Anything you want.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You think for a moment, and it is clear to both of you there is something particular on your mind. She is paying such close attention she notes as your face takes on a peculiar quality. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What did Dr. Moyhannon put in my file?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	It is only with great skill that Dr. Whitmore does not give away how prepared she is for this question. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“He filled out most of the personality test he administered to you, and only a few extra lines. The answers to the personality test are standard, and I could go into more specifics if you like. But the few lines he wrote in the comments area, I assume, are going to be the place of interest for you. It reads: ‘Subject remained under control during confrontation, and showed no signs of aggressive behavior; definite trauma and possible narcissistic disorder. Patient shows evidence of a possible psychotic break?’”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Thank you.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Well, I feel it is important that you know the truth.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Narcissistic disorder?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“The traditional definition is an overinflated sense of self-importance and an extreme preoccupation with one’s self. I am not too concerned though, I see some potential but you are far from a worst-case scenario. I know Dr Moyhannon likes to be thorough, so he felt the need to mention it.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What about the rest of it?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Which part?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Your lips purse, and you cross your legs. You wonder why the doctor is dragging this out. A quick glance at her from the side of your eyes tells you. Every muscle in her body is screaming that she has information she doesn’t want you to get. The only way to know is by asking, and you desperately want to know.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What about the psychotic break?”
 	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	She flips through some pages of the file in front of her, clears her throat, and plays with the file a little more before she looks at you full on again.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am not sure what to say because I don’t think we should get into that just yet.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“And that is because you need to know what I thought about the orange room.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“The requirements go something like that, yes.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I keep telling you, the orange room really isn’t important.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“We both know that isn’t true.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“It was summer outside. Does that tell you something? Why does it matter so much?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	This time Dr. Whitmore initiates the pause, and you re-cross your legs to show disapproval. The doctor isn’t giving an inch, and you know she is going to wait all day if she must. If it even is day, who can tell? You haven’t seen daylight for weeks now. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I died in the orange room.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	It would show in the record after that: 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Subject began screaming at a high volume without pause for approximately 	three minutes before two orderlies were able to subdue with an injection of .75 mg of Halidol. During the period before patient lost consciousness she destroyed the better part of her chair, and carved large gouges in the table with the ring she wore on her right hand. Patient was subdued for six hours, and kept on restraints for another three. After passing a number of basic psych tests patient was allowed to be unrestrained in her room.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Three days later Dr. Whitmore and you sit at the same table with the gouges still marring its surface.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“How are you feeling today, Juliet?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Better.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You have been off the meds for a few hours now. Have you resumed any clarity or memory yet?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is a pause. Then you bleakly answer, “Yes.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You don’t quite sound like yourself.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“No.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Do you want to give it another little while?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“No.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“The orderly came and got me. She said that you called and yelled until she came and you told her you needed to see me right away. So here I am. Do you have something you need to tell me?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Yes.” A half a minute passes before, “I remembered when I was left alone in that room.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	A breath raggedly drawn in for a few seconds, then held for an unnatural amount of time and the doctor looks worried you are about to have another fit. Finally you continue.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“It reminded me of the orange room in there. That is the room where I died. Someone killed me. I was poisoned.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I did some research while you were unavailable. It indicates on the admittance form from Bellevue they had to pump your stomach. The contents were a full fifty count prescription of Xanax.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is a pause as you lift your head, breathe quickly, and then let it drop again. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“However on further research the corresponding police report indicates they found you alone in a hotel room on the bed with the bottle in your hand. I also checked through a few phone calls to housekeeping staff, the color scheme of the room is green.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“They put it that way.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Its possible, but the police found no evidence of anyone else in the room. At the very least, you did not die there.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I died, and they killed me.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Who are they?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Another short pause, “I don’t know.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What evidence do you have that someone is trying to kill you?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You don’t understand me. We aren’t really here because I am dead.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“If that is true then we have two options. One is that you really are dead in which case I would very much enjoy hearing your explanation of our meetings. Otherwise, you have a disease called Cotard’s Syndrome.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You think I am making this up?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I have every hope that this is a defense mechanism you have enacted to deal with a trauma. You show no other markers of having Cotard’s, which leads me to believe your mind has received some kind of shock. All of this is positive, though, in that you could be exhibiting much more detrimental symptoms.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What do you mean?”	
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Well, Cotard’s Syndrome is very serious. You would be at risk of not only a psychotic break, but also for extreme self-abuse.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What is Cotard’s Syndrome?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“It is a derivative of Capgrass Syndrome, but essentially it describes anyone who believes not only that they are dead, but they also may have no blood in their body, missing organs, or any number of variations.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t want to hurt myself.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Then why did you take all those pills?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I didn’t do that!”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You sit for a moment frustrated. You can see that the doctor is getting exasperated as well.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Juliet, we are just going around in circles. I need you to give me any kind of new information.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You can feel your blood start to boil inside.The words slip out before you have time to stop them. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“How about this for something you don’t know! I am here to investigate your practice, and so far things aren’t looking very well!”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Dr. Whitmore gapes at you in complete shock, but like authentic surprise, it lasts for only a second. She flips closed the file that she had been working from, gets up, and walks out the door. Clearly, you succeeded in finding some new information.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	It takes fifteen minutes for the doctor to remember to send an orderly to escort you back to the room. You can’t help but think about the things that must be going through her mind as you sit and stare at the knothole. Her mind must be racing with questions like, is that why you have been so reluctant to tell anyone your name? Because as soon as you do they will know you have no business as a patient.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Only what you think exists.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	An orderly enters. He is one you haven’t seen before. You would remember because he has an incredibly open friendly face. At this particular moment, a beautiful chuckle is escaping from inside that smile. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You can’t help but ask, “What is so funny?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am just wondering what you have done, because you have Dr. Whitmore running around all terrified out there.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I just didn’t want to have to talk anymore. She will figure out I am lying soon enough, and then she will probably take that out on me.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I doubt that, Dr. Whitmore doesn’t work that way. I have made a few mistakes in my time, and she has never unfairly punished me for any of them.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Something about the way he says this gives you the feeling it means more than its face value. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What kind of mistakes have you made? Did you have sex with the doctor?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	His face shows shock, but whether that is at your perceptiveness, or the idea of what you have proposed you can’t tell. You are suddenly fascinated, and want to know more about this mysterious orderly.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What is your name?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Charlie. Charlie Epilode.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Juliet and I don’t know my last name. Epilode, that is very strange. What kind of name is that?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t really know. My parents were drunks, so I didn’t get a lot of lessons in family history.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I know what you mean, my husband is a drunk.” You blush red, and try to breathe deeply to get it to pass. You hadn’t told anyone about that yet. Luckily, Charlie doesn’t know the difference. You can hear Kimberly inside a room in the middle of the hall. She is yelling on the phone, presumably at Dr. Moyhannon, giving you a deep sense of triumph. This is why Charlie takes you off balance with his strange question. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You remember that you have a husband, but you don’t remember your last name?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Damn. “Promise not to tell anybody Charlie Epilode?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	He nods his head quickly which doesn’t instill an incredible amount of confidence. You decide that you would be willing to give up a little information to find out some from him.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“My last name is Bandone. What mistakes have you made, Charlie?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“There are too many to tell you about right now. How about I bring you breakfast tomorrow, and we can talk about it then?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	When the door opens in the morning, and it isn’t Charlie you are sad. This pales when you discover the true purpose of the early wake up. Dr. Whitmore is already sitting at the table, in the now all white room, and she looks very angry. This is much worse than you imagined when you pulled that stunt. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I know a lot more than I did yesterday, Juliet.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You don’t say anything, thinking about Miranda Rights. Anything you say right now could get you into much worse trouble. At this point, you can’t even remember what you have admitted.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I know that you are not investigating our practice in any way.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I know, and I am sorry. I really didn’t want to talk anymore yesterday. I should have just told you.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“That is nowhere near enough. I have already called the police and they are on the way to pick you up. Your lies have finally caught up with you.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“What?” Your mind is reeling. “I don’t understand, what happened?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Trying to get things by having a relationship with an orderly is considered inappropriate behavior. Juliet Bandone is wanted for the murder of her husband, and her brother. They didn’t try to kill you in the orange room, Juliet, you killed them.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	There is true venom in the doctor’s voice. You can feel every opportunity slipping away. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“That isn’t what happened! It was self-defense. I remember now. All the water and the inlets, it was the blood, and in the orange room they came after me. I had to protect myself. And I didn’t proposition Charlie!”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t believe any of this, Juliet. My protocol is clearly dictated, and in this case I have to admit that Dr. Moyhannon was completely right.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You can’t do this Kimberly! Dr. Whitmore! You can’t send me to prison for something I didn’t do.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“You just admitted to killing them Juliet and it is up to a jury to decide whether or not it was self-defense. I will also mention to you given the evidence I have plans to appear at your trial to argue against that defense.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I can’t believe you would say that to me! Have you really grown to hate me so badly that you wish me such torture?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	She pauses for a moment chewing her lip. You feel a glimmer of hope for the first time since you woke up. When you saw it wasn’t Charlie. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I admit, I expected for you to react with some kind of aggression after such a direct attack. Can you explain your attempt to take advantage of the orderly yesterday?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I don’t know what Mr. Epilode told you, but I felt bad about what happened as soon as you left yesterday, and I mentioned something. We went back and forth briefly, and he is the first person I have met in months that would have a normal conversation with me.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You can see her resolve cracking, so you keep your mouth shut. You have absolutely no intention of messing up a good thing. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“Are you ready to talk to me about what happened with your husband and your brother?”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	“I am tired, and I feel bad about what happened yesterday. But I will talk about it if you want.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	You feel her watching you with apprehension. Then with a deep sigh she says the words you had been hoping. “No, I will give you a break. Head back to your room. Take a nap, but I will be coming to get you again later today.”
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	She steps outside of the room, and leaves the door open a crack. You lean in to hear as she tells the orderly to call the police and tell them to wait for further information about Juliet Bandone. You breathe a sigh of relief, at least you aren’t going to prison tonight. You will have to get out of here soon, now that you have burned the bridge with Charlie, that asshole. The proper phone calls are made, and Dr. Whitmore comes back to escort you to your room personally. 
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Once you are there, you cross the threshold into the five by five room. The bolt slides into the door, and Dr. Whitmore stands at the window to watch for a few minutes. You sit on the bed, the only piece of furniture, until you are sure she is gone. You watch the walls, completely white, and completely impenetrable.
	
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Only what you think, exists.
